## Setting up git hub instructions
For Software Github, you all have been added as collaborators, but to actually pull and push (in other words retrieve, edit and publish your code) you need to clone the repository. To do this you can follow a few simple steps. 

*Note: When commands are shown I have put them in quotes. When actually typing these commands in terminal DO NOT put the quotes.

1. Login to GitHub and go to our team repository

2. Click on the green arrow that displays the text “Code”

3. If you have SSH set up then copy the link, other wise use HTTPS. Note that using HTTPS works just as well as SSH, however with HTTPS you will need to enter your GitHub credentials (username and password) each time you want to perform a task.

4. Open terminal and navigate to a folder that you would like to store the repo in. Since we all have mac, use the short cuts “cd” to change your directory. Example usage: Assuming you have a folder called "Robotics" and you would like to enter that folder, the commands you would enter would be "cd Robotics".

5. To actually clone the repo onto your local device, you need to type in the following command: “git clone <url>” where the <url> is the SSH or HTTPS url that you have copied from GitHub. Important Note: Cloning the repo creates a folder with an identical name to our GitHub repo.
  
6. Once you have cloned the repo, navigate to the folder containing the repo. Use the “cd” command to do this. Once inside your repo, you need to pull the existing changes. In terminal type in the command “git pull”. This will pull all the changes made in the remote repository into your local laptop.

7. That is it for now. Follow those steps and you will be set up for GitHub. In the future we will guide you through other actions like committing, branches, pull requests and merge conflicts. If you are stuck or need any help please don’t feel shy to ask the second years. We will be glad to help you out. Great work.


# Meeting Notes

We should keep software meeting note logs in this readme.md file. It will be a good show to the judges to show our organization as a team and it will serve as a nice way to keep track of our progress here as well.
